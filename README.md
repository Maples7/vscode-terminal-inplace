[VSCode Extension] Launch your own vscode terminal in the directory of your focus file.

## Usage

There are 2 ways to use this extension in [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/):

1. Use shortcut `alt+ctrl+\`` to launch an inner terminal whose current working directory is the directory in where your open focus file stay. As we all know, by default in VSCode, `ctrl+\`` can toggle the inner terminal and this is unchanged. That's to say, by adding an `alt`, we make a candy for the inner terminal in VSCode.
2. Open Command Palette in VSCode and find `Terminal In Place` command to execute.
